# scripts

# to-do
- planned to rewrite ytwl with youtube's API so that it isn't taking like 2GB of memory just to load simple html page (which is dumb obviously)
- talking of ytwl, planend to have something like sxiv preview thing
- another point to ytwl is to add an ability to remove things from planed-to-watch list but it boils down to just using API instead of web driver
- maybe rewrite all the remaining scripts to be POSIX-compliant
- idk, maybe will add more useful scripts, like batch-dl (cause it's pretty cool)
